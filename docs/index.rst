POISE User Guide
================

POISE (*Parameter Optimisation by Iterative Spectral Evaluation*) is a Python package for on-the-fly optimisation of NMR parameters in Bruker's TopSpin software.

On this website you will find guides on setting POISE up and using it in routine NMR applications.
This guide can largely be read in sequence, but depending on your level of interaction with the software, we have suggested various starting points:

 - **It's been set up by somebody else, and I'm just an end user.**

   You can proceed straight to `running`.

 - **I need to set this up from scratch!**

   You probably want to read most of this. Start off at `install`; from there you can go on to `routines`.
 
 - **I know basic Python and want to create customised cost functions.**

   Assuming you're already familiar with `routines`, then go straight to `costfunctions`!

 - **I want to tweak the code itself.**

   `dev` has all the behind-the-scenes explanations that you'd need.
