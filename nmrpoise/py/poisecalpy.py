Python script which automates p1 optimisation using POISE. Behaves similarly to
pulsecal: optimises the value of p1 in expno 99999, then sets the optimised
value to the current dataset and shows a message.

This does not have the command-line argument functionality of the poisecal AU
programme, and tends to suffer from some edge-case bugs which are not present
in poisecal. This is generally a result of TopSpin's Python programmes being
more buggy than AU programmes. Nonetheless, as a result of this, we recommend
using the poisecal AU programme instead of this (which is retained mainly to
serve as a illustrative example in the documentation).
